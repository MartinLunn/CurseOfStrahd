- Fear is cause heightened when the darkness engulfs us
- Not the monster, but it's shadow that breeds horror
- More we know, less scary
- keep scary stuff out of the light as long as possible

Tricks:
before a monster appears:
- describe the odour that precedes it
- eerie sound it makes
- weird shadow it casts
