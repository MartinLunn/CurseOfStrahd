- Darkness is a silent crowd that follows the characters everywhere and stares at then while they sleep
- Trees are towering giants that stand idle yet ever watchful as characters face the perils of the Svalich Woods alone
- groaning house 
- wailing wind
- grasping mud
- squatting chest
- torches sputter nervously
- rusty hinges shatter silence with they sudden cries of anguish
- cobwebs quietly beckon us  to our doom
